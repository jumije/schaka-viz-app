### A hands-on environment for your journey into cancer data analysis.

This interactive app is your companion for the "Genomische Geheimnisse" course. Here, you will not just see visualizationsâ€”you will build, modify, and experiment with them yourself.

#### How to Use This Lab:

1.  ðŸ‘ˆ **Navigate using the sidebar on the left.**
2.  **Start at the `Data Lab` page.** This is where you'll generate the simulated dataset that all other pages will use. You can create different scenarios to see how data properties affect the story a plot can tell.
3.  **Explore the visualization pages.** Each page is a lesson dedicated to a specific plot type.
    *   Read the **"Learn More"** section to understand the theory.
    *   Use the **"Control Panel"** to experiment with plot parameters without writing code.
    *   Tackle the **"Coding Sandbox"** to answer a scientific question by modifying Python code directly and seeing the results instantly!

Let's begin!
